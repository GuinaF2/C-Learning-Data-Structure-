# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms in C

This repository contains code, exercises, and practical implementations developed during the **Data Structures** course (3rd Term).

The main goal is to study the logic behind fundamental algorithms and memory management using the **C language**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The files are organized by topic in the following folders:

* **Algoritmos de Ordenação**: Implementation of sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
* **Arvore Binaria**: Binary tree structures, including node insertion, search, and deletion.
* **Grafos**: Graph representations, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS).
* **Heuristica**: Algorithms focused on problem-solving heuristics and optimization.
* **Ponteiros**: Exercises focused on memory allocation and pointer manipulation.
* **Vetores e Matrizes**: Basic manipulation of vectors (1D arrays) and matrices (2D arrays).

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run

To execute any of the codes, you will need a C compiler (such as `gcc`).

Example command via terminal:

```bash
# Compile
gcc filename.c -o output

# Run (Windows)
./output.exe

# Run (Linux/Mac)
./output
```
